This boilerplate is a good starting place for developing with Express and AngularJS, with Gulp task automation for development and production environments. Currently, there is no support for server-side API calls; if you are interested in this, consult this excellent blog post:

Forking?
-----------------------
You'll need to install node.js and gulp to start.

Then clone the project and cd into the directory.

	`$ git clone git@github.com:MarsWilliams/Gulp-Express-Angular-Starter.git`
	`$ cd Gulp-Express-Angular-Starter`

Install development dependecies with npm.

	`$ npm install`

For developemt (will start server on port 1337 and run browser-sync):

	`$ gulp dev`

For production (to bundle/uglify scripts and minify styles for build):

	`$ gulp dev`

I'm happy to answer any questions you may have or help with installation.
